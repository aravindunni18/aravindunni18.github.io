    <h1>Hello, I'm Aravind Unni</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring computational research student with a background in Chemical Engineering. I completed my bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC) and went on to pursue a master's degree in the same field from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). During my master's, I had the opportunity to work on studying the nucleation of NaCl in solutions through molecular simulation techniques, which involved working with Monte Carlo and MD simulations, as well as Hybrid Monte Carlo techniques.</p>
    <p>Currently, as a Project Associate I under the guidance of Professor Sudeep Punnathanam, I continue to research nucleation systems. While my research interests extend beyond nucleation and include energy systems, catalysis, biomolecular systems, and more, I am primarily focused on computational research. As such, I am interested in exploring the potential applications of AI and machine learning in computational research, and hope to incorporate these techniques into my work in the future.</p>
    <p>Outside of my studies and research, I enjoy an active lifestyle. I like swimming, cycling, playing basketball, and going on short adventure trips such as hiking and long journeys. I am also an avid reader and enjoy learning about new topics.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website and feel free to explore more about my research interests and projects.</p>
